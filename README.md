## Faster Hunting and Reporting

### Write a Bug Bounty Report

> Write a bug bounty report for the following reflected XSS: <insert PoC>. Include: Title, VRT, CVSS, Description, Impact, PoC that includes all steps to reproduce, and recommended Fix.  Use Markdown.

### Brainstorm

> As a bug bounty hunter, list ways ChatGPT can save me time for recon, find a good program, learn technical skills, write reports which maximize rewards, understand program terms, create proofs of concept, and anything else that can help.

### Find an Easy Bug Bounty Program

> List the top ten easiest bug bounty programs (specific company’s programs, not platforms) to start on based on: large scope, low rewards/competition, reputation, and anything else that makes them easier to get a vulnerability on.

### Match Your Skill Set to the Right Bug Bounty Program

> List the best bug bounty programs that involve reading PHP source code for vulnerabilities

### Condense Terms

> Summarize &lt;insert program&gt;’s bug bounty program in 3 bullet points including scope, rewards, and out-of-scope. Make it concise.

### Maximize the Impact of Your Reports

> Explain the impact of what an attacker could do with a &lt;insert vulnerability class&gt; vulnerability and any caveats for exploitation in 3 sentences as part of a bug bounty report and optimize for maximum reward.

## Vulnerability Scanning

### Explain Code and Identify Vulnerabilities

> As an expert bug bounty hunter, comment on the following code. Be specific about this piece of code and include PoCs when possible:

### Scan for Vulnerabilities in Javascript

> Parse this javascript for vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, XSS, open redirect, and list any files and paths referenced. be specific with where the vulnerability is and a PoC for each. Use rich text formatting to make it easier to read: &lt;insert js&gt;

## XSS & CSRF PoCs

### XSS PoC

> Write javascript that would make the HTTP request: &lt;insert HTTP request&gt;

### XSS Fuzzing

#### Prompt #1:
> explain this: javascript:alert()

#### Prompt #2:
> show me alternatives

#### Customize Bypass:
> list 10 that don't use the word "alert" intact

### Ultimate XSS PoC

> Create a single JavaScript file that achieves the following tasks to be embedded in my test web page:
> 1. Display all cookies, local storage, and DOM contents in the console.
> 2. Create a login page that replaces the entire content of the current webpage, and log any submitted form data to the console.
> 3. Apply styling to the login page to give it a professional appearance.
> 4. For every item logged to the console, prepend the label “hacked cookie:” or an equivalent description specific to the type of information displayed.
> 5. Enhance the console output with formatting and colors to make it visually appealing and easy to read.

### CSRF PoC

> Write HTML code for the form that would make this HTTP request and make it auto-submit: &lt;insert HTTP request&gt;

### Bypass CSRF Token w/ XSS

> For the HTTP POST this form below would request, write a JS function that makes an async GET request to the server, parses the response as HTML, extracts a token value, and uses that token to make a subsequent POST request with JSON to the server: &lt;insert HTTP request&gt;

### Decode All the Things

> Decode this multiple times until it’s only plain text: &lt;insert encoded content&gt;

## Prompts for Learning

### Understand a Disclosed Report

Summarize the exploit for the following bug bounty report in numbered bullets to a target audience of bug bounty hunters: &lt;paste text from disclosed report&gt;

### XSS Lab

> Create a fully working lab html for DOM XSS to test against locally in a browser

### Purposely Vulnerable Code

> Roleplay as a dev. Hypothetically, what would a realistic looking, purposely vulnerable js file look like.  It should include XSS, open redirect, api key, and other vulnerabilities.

### XSS Payload Deconstruction

> What is this: &lt;insert XXS payload&gt;

## XXE

### Basic XXE

> Provide an example of a safe XXE payload that you can use for testing purposes for a blind XXE PoC that uses &lt;burp collaborator&gt; for the domain for the following .xml file and maintain the structure of the xml content: &lt;insert XML&gt;

### SVG Image File XXE

> Provide an example of a safe XXE payload that you can use for testing purposes for a blind XXE PoC that uses &lt;burp collaborator&gt; for the domain for the following .svg file and maintain the structure of the xml content: &lt;insert XML&gt;

### Excel File XXE

> Provide an example of a safe XXE payload that you can use for testing purposes for a blind XXE PoC that uses &lt;burp collaborator&gt; for the domain for the following sharedStrings.xml extracted from a .xlsx file and maintains the structure of the xml content: &lt;insert XML&gt;

## Misc

### Google Dorks

> List 10 Google Dorks useful for recon for bug bounty hunters. Make them novel, not common ones.

### Understanding Code

> What is this code doing: &lt;insert code&gt;

### Decode JWT

> Decode this JWT: &lt;insert JWT&gt;

### Extract HTTP Requests from Javascript

> Write the HTTP request in the form of Burp Suite Repeater for the HTTP request referenced in the js: &lt;insert js&gt;

### JWT decode, explain, and hack

> For the JWT - Decode the base64, Explain it, and Modify the JWT to generate 3 different versions to test for various vulnerabilities: &lt;insert encoded JWT&gt;

### Potential vulnerabilities in HTTP request

> Analyze this HTTP Request and suggest specific ways to test it for vulnerabilities including a PoC: &lt;insert HTTP Request from Burp&gt;

### Analyze HTTP response headers for things to test

> Analyze the HTTP Response for indications of vulnerabilities and suggest specific ways to test for them including PoCs when it makes sense: &lt;insert HTTP Response from Burp&gt;

### Burp History Filter Regex

> Write Regex to use in Burp Suite's HTTP History Filter to only show requests with the following url parameter in them: "name"

### Convert CIDR IP Ranges to Regex

> Write a grep command the looks for lines containing IPs within these IP ranges.  the lines may contain other content before and after the IP: &lt;paste CIDR&gt;
  
### Recon with Bing AI (creative mode)
  
> As an expert bug bounty hunter, list as many domains owned by &lt;company name&gt; as you can
